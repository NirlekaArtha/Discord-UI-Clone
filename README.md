# Discord UI Clone

This is a discord's UI clone. I made this by myself, using Tailwindcss and vanilla jacascript. Feel free to use it for your own purposes.

# How to use 

To use this template, make a new directory. Then, open your terminal and simply write

git clone https://github.com/NirlekaArtha/Discord-UI-Clone.git

and voila, its already loaded to your local machine. To continue developing
this template dont forget to do npm install first, to install all dependencies.

# NOTE
This UI clone may be suck, but whatever...
